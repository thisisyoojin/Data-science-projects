## Hello, I am Yoojin Ko!
I am a passionate on data acquisition and analysis who is interested in manipulating data and creating business value from it. This page is the overview of machine learning projects I have developed. It includes a short description for each project and if you want to know more, please visit the repository by clicking the link.

Data Acquisition
- [Lost Pet Alarms](https://github.com/thisisyoojin/lost-pets-alarms)</br>
Currently, missing/found/stray dog data is scattered on multiple websites with different structures of data. The data is also focused on the dog only, even though data of the last seen place might be crucial to find the missing dog. The goal of this project is to create a centralised dataset, which is consisting of dog and location-based data.

- [Game Data Collection](https://github.com/thisisyoojin/steam-game-data)</br>
As part of a  project aiming to predict game scores, data of games released on the Steam platform is collected from APIs and an official website. Collected data is preprocessed and stored in local DB and AWS RDS.

Data Science
- [Game Feature Extraction with NN](https://github.com/thisisyoojin/Game-Feature-Extraction-with-NN)</br>
Game Feature Extraction is predicting game features with deep learning model(CNN, RNN) from raw unconstructed data such as text and images.
