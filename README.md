## Hello, I am Yoojin Ko!
I am a passionate data scientist who is interested in manipulating data and creating business value from it. This page is the overview of machine learning projects I have developed. It includes a short description for each project and if you want to know more, please visit the repository by clicking the link.

- [Pedict Metacritic Score of Steam Games](https://github.com/thisisyoojin/Game-Score-Prediction)</br>
Game Score Prediction project is a pipeline for collecting data, creating database, and predicting score from steam game data. The data is collected from steam API and custom made web crawler. Collected data is saved locally first, then preprocessed and saved in cloud(AWS) by a configuration file provided. Preprocessed data is used to create models to predict metacritic score.

- [Game Feature Extraction with NN](https://github.com/thisisyoojin/Game-Feature-Extraction-with-NN)</br>
Game Feature Extraction is predicting game features with deep learning model(CNN, RNN) from raw unconstructed data such as text and images.
